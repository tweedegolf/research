## Distributed web

Also called the permanent web. Why do we need a distributed web?

- We use a lot of tools that are unavailable offline (google docs, facebook, twitter, web-mail).
- In the outskirts of the internet bandwidth might be poor (rural or less developed areas).
- Weak wifi in public transport or airplanes.
- Sometimes you cannot move files from a mobile to a laptop without internet.
- Circumvent latency
- A centralized web can be shut off easily by malicious companies and governments (Egypt took the internet down on Jan 28th 2013).
- A centralized web is vulnerable (natural disasters, fire in data-center, power outages).
- Centralized web results in massive amount of unnecessary bandwidth usage (if we are all in the same room working on a Google Doc, we all have to download the document from the backbone).
- Permanence; avoids digital equivalent of book-burnings
- Webpages disappear because the author stops the hosting (dead links)
- Open web: everyone can publish (no hosting party needed)
- Digital vellum: information that is stored on legacy computers / operating systems / storage

### Bandwidth

In the past years bandwidth has increased to a lesser extent than the amount of storage you can get for the same money. This means that we can store bigger files on the web but we can not download them faster. In fact internet becomes slower if file-sizes increase at a faster pace than bandwidth.

### Location addressing

A url points to one location where the file can be found and you have to retrieve the file from that very location even if the file is available on a computer nearby.
