## Distributed web

Also called the permanent web. Why do we need a distributed web?

- We use a lot of tools that are unavailable offline (google docs, facebook, twitter, webmail).
- In the outskirts of the internet bandwidth might be poor (rural / less developed areas).
- Weak wifi in public transport or airplanes.
- When documents are concentrated on one server they can be shut off by malicious companies / governments (Egypt 2013).
- Centralized web results in massive amount of unnecessary bandwidth usage (if we are all in the same room working on a Google Doc, we all have to download the document from the backbone).


### Location addressing

A url points to one location where the file can be found and you have to retrieve the file from that very location even if the file is available on a computer nearby.
